# re288-matrix

This code demonstrates how to create an RE288 run expectancy matrix from Statcast data. Run expectancy matrices are 
the building blocks of modern sabermetrics and it's essential for anyone to know why they're important, where they 
come from, and how to reproduce one. It's far from perfect, but I've managed to come up with a passable first draft
of an RE288 matrix that mirrors the one created by Tom Tango (https://twitter.com/tangotiger/status/1065795843976978432?lang=en)
